NAME
    Perl::Folder - Fold and Unfold Blocks in Perl Code

DESCRIPTION
    Using regexps to look for values in Perl code is problematic. This
    module makes it much more reliable.

    Say you are looking for a line like this one:

        our $VERSION = '0.10';

    Matching that line is easy. But that line might be in a heredoc, the
    "DATA" section, a POD block or a comment. Also if you try to strip out
    all heredocs you don't know if they are really part of a POD block of
    "DATA" section, and vice versa.

    This module correctly finds these four types of blocks and folds them
    up, replacing their content with the SHA1 digest of their content.
